# ü§ñ ChatGPT Project Progress Log

This file tracks progress, decisions, and major actions taken with ChatGPT regarding the `hydro_pinn_OOP` project.

## üóìÔ∏è Date: 2024-06-25

### ‚úÖ GitHub / VSCode Setup Summary

- Created local project folder: `hydro_pinn_OOP`
- Initialized Git repo and connected it to GitHub: [amitPorat/hydro_pinn_OOP](https://github.com/amitPorat/hydro_pinn_OOP)
- Created core structure using folders:
  - `src/` with all logic modules
  - `data/`, `notebooks/`, `config/`, `docs/`
- Added `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`, and full `README.md`
- Pushed proof-of-concept notebooks into `notebooks/Darga basin POC/`
- Created and pushed shapefile of Israel basins into `data/basins/`
- Updated and pushed `example_config.yaml` into `config/` folder
- Created `main.py` for config-driven rainfall pipeline
- Confirmed `git pull`, `push`, conflict handling, and VSCode Git flow

### üÜï Documentation Files Added

- `docs/DATA.md`: Description of datasets (rain, basins, flow)
- `README.md`: Now links to `DATA.md` and includes usage notes
- üÜï `chatgpt.md`: This file ‚Äì meant to document daily or major milestones for reference when returning to the project


## üê≥ Docker and Environment Setup (New)

- Created a `Dockerfile` for the project (supports CPU/GPU runtime)
- Added `requirements.txt` with all Python dependencies
- Both files added to project root and tested in local VSCode
- `docker build` and `docker run` work end-to-end with config-based execution
- These files are version-controlled and compatible with deployment pipeline

### üîú Next Planned Step

- Implement `src/data_utils/basin_utils.py` to load shapefile and extract basin bounding box by name
- Then: implement `rain_loader.py` using `netCDF4`, Torch (optional), and spatial masking

## üìå Project Summary

**Project name:** `hydro_pinn_OOP`  
**Goal:** Build a modular, production-ready system for rainfall-runoff prediction using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), XPINN, and advanced spatio-temporal datasets.

### üîß Technologies:
- PyTorch (LSTM, FCN, physics loss)
- PhysicsNeMo (planned)
- NetCDF4 (rainfall), CSV (discharge), Shapefiles (basins)
- GeoPandas, Pandas, Torch, Matplotlib, Folium, YAML configs
- Future integration with Docker, GitHub, CLI automation

### üî¨ What We Have Done So Far:
- Proof of concept completed in Jupyter notebooks
- A model that predicts discharge based on rainfall using LSTM + physics (Manning/infiltration)
- High-performing predictions on measured stations using real rainfall from 2010‚Äì2022
- Reduced initial region of study from entire Dead Sea area to `Darga` basin

### üöß Intentions Going Forward:
- Build a modular, testable codebase (`src/`) usable on a future high-performance server
- Use GitHub and VSCode to maintain structured, documented, reproducible code
- Support configuration through YAML/XML for full pipeline runs
- Build support for ungauged basin forecasting using:
  - Transfer learning
  - AutoEncoders (future)
  - Curriculum learning (strong-to-weak events, channel-to-slope areas)
  - Analog basin matching

# chatgpt.md ‚Äì Project Development Log for `hydro_pinn_OOP`

This document tracks the evolution, key milestones, architectural shifts, and design choices in the hydrological PINN-based flood prediction system (`hydro_pinn_OOP`). It combines insights from code notebooks, planning documents (Sprint Manifest, Work Plan 2.0), and observed experimental phases.

---

## üß™ Phase 1: Initial Proof of Concept (POC) ‚Äì Small-Scale

- **Timeframe:** Early development
- **Focus Area:** North Dead Sea
- **Years Covered:** 2012‚Äì2013
- **Structure:**
  - Used full timestep data ‚Üí ~13M rows/year
  - Basic features: rainfall, elevation, slope (with many NaNs), rg_qms
  - Model: basic NN, no physics
- **Problems:**
  - Very large datasets caused memory overload
  - Many dry timesteps added noise and inefficiency
  - Missing slope values, weak spatial support
- **Fixes:**
  - Switched to event-based slicing (Nov‚ÄìApr, discharge threshold)
  - Reduced data by >10√ó
  - Added Tau (normalized event time)

---

## üìà Phase 2: Scaling the POC ‚Äì More Years & Data Cleanup

- **Years Added:** 2014‚Äì2016, 2018‚Äì2020
- **Challenges:**
  - Inconsistent time indexing per year (Tau reset per year)
  - Missing values in slope_calculated
- **Fixes:**
  - Global timestamp normalization across all years (Global Tau)
  - Filled missing slope values (e.g. mean imputation)
  - Event-based filtering extended to all years

---

## üåê Phase 3: Spatial Data Enrichment (UGRID)

- **Static Dataset Added:** UGRID (DEM-derived + hydro features)
- **Features Added:**
  - Area, slope, flow direction, stream order, aspect, TRI, TPI, roughness, D50, Manning n, etc.
- **Fixes:**
  - Merged with event data via grid cell ID or lat/lon
  - Verified station cells have STREAM_CELL=1 and realistic area values
  - Replaced slope_calculated with UGRID‚Äôs complete slope where needed

---

## üöÄ Phase 4: Pipeline Efficiency & Parquet Conversion

- **Problems:**
  - CSVs were slow and memory-heavy to load (1.6GB+/year)
  - Repeating preprocessing was time-consuming
- **Fixes:**
  - Preprocessed each year once and saved as `.parquet`
  - Unified structure with global Tau and UGRID-merged features
  - Batch loaded via list of Parquet paths (train/test)

---

## üß† Phase 5: Model Refinement with Physics-Informed Loss (PINN)

- **Model Structure:**
  - Input: rainfall, Tau, spatial features
  - Output: predicted discharge (log q)
- **Loss Function:**
  - `loss_total = loss_data + Œª * loss_physics`
  - loss_physics split into collocation points and station residuals
- **Stability Techniques:**
  - Gradient clipping
  - Progressive training (SCS ‚Üí Delta-Q ‚Üí KW ‚Üí SWE)
  - Epoch-based refinement

---


## üßæ Configuration File Overhaul (2025-07-01)

- Rebuilt the core YAML configuration file (`config.yaml`) to reflect actual user choices and architecture.
- Introduced `data_selection.method` key to switch between:
  - `date_range`: conventional start/end date splits
  - `event_based`: filter by rainy season and thresholds (active mode)
- Defined clear `train`, `validation`, and `test` periods when using date-based selection.
- Added full support for physics-informed configurations with hierarchical domains:
  - `main_channel`: Shallow Water Equations (SWE)
  - `slopes`: Kinematic Wave (KW)
  - `junctions`: continuity constraint
- Included `physics.enabled`, `hierarchy_mode`, and per-domain PDE logic
- Added `loss_weights`, `early_stopping`, and full optimizer control under `training`
- Output section expanded to support saving logs, checkpoints, TensorBoard, and final model
- Designed for long-term use on future high-performance servers and automated CLI

## üß© Sprint Manifest ‚Äì Final Phase of POC (Last Few Weeks)

- **Tasks Completed:**
  - Equation assignment per cell (SWE, KW, Delta-Q, SCS-CN)
  - Manning's n estimated per cell (SWE)
  - Kriging interpolation across quadtree resolutions (7K, 16K, 70K)
  - Data merge: rainfall + spatial + discharge
  - Tau-based formatting (6h, 12h lead time)
  - New architecture + loss function updates
  - Resolution-specific experiments (3x per resolution)
  - Gradual training transitions (physics-based)
  - Hyperparameter tuning started
- **Tools Used:** Docker, Git, VSCode

  1. Finalize high-res POC for North Dead Sea (5‚Äì6 months)
  2. Expand to 17 additional hydro-regions across Israel
  3. Add generalization layer for ungauged areas (AutoEncoder)
  4. Deploy user-facing dashboards + professional environment
